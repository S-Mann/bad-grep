# Introduction

This is my take on [grep](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html).
I wrote it in a way so that vscode [line navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_navigate-to-a-specific-line) works for grep.
This is grep(without all its features) with one extra feature written in rust.

# Installation

> Note: You will need rust and cargo to build the binaries for your platform.

- You can easily build the binaries using:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:S-Mann/bad-grep.git
$ cd ./bad-grep
$ cargo install --path .
```

- Then you can run it using:

```sh
$ bad-grep "your query" "relative/full path to file"
```
